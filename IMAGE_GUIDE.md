# Image Setup Guide

This guide will help you choose and prepare the perfect images for your tongue detection app!

## Required Images

You need **2 PNG images**:

1. **`apple.png`** - Displayed when tongue is NOT out (normal state)
2. **`appletongue.png`** - Displayed when tongue IS out (silly state)

Both images will automatically be resized to **960x720 pixels**, so any size works!

## Where to Find Images

**Suggested combos:**

**How to prepare photos:**

## Image Requirements

### ✅ Must Have:
- File format: **PNG** (.png extension)

- Location: Same folder as `main.py`

### 📋 Recommended:
- High contrast images (easier to see)
- Bright colors (more fun!)
- Similar themes (creates a good before/after effect)
- Square or landscape orientation (looks better when resized)

### ❌ Avoid:
- Very dark images (hard to see)
- Tiny images (will look pixelated when enlarged)
- Corrupted files (won't load)
- Copyrighted material (if sharing publicly)

## Step-by-Step: Download Example Images

Let's use emoji as an example:

### 1. Download apple.png (Normal State)

1. Go to [Emojipedia - Red Apple](https://emojipedia.org/red-apple)
2. Scroll down to a platform (e.g., "Apple" or "Google")
3. Right-click the large emoji image → "Save image as..."
4. Save as `apple.png` in your project folder

### 2. Download appletongue.png (Tongue Out State)

1. Go to [Emojipedia - Face with Tongue](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tongue)
2. Choose your favorite style
3. Right-click → "Save image as..."
4. Save as `appletongue.png` in your project folder

### 3. Verify Files

Check that you have:
```
next/
├── main.py
├── apple.png          ← This file
├── appletongue.png    ← This file
└── ...
```

## Converting Other Formats to PNG

Have a JPG or other format? Convert it:

### Online (Easiest):
1. Go to [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/)
2. Upload your image
3. Select "PNG" as output format
4. Download the converted file

### Using Paint (Windows):
1. Open the image in Paint
2. File → Save As → PNG
3. Rename to `apple.png` or `appletongue.png`

### Using Preview (Mac):
1. Open the image in Preview
2. File → Export
3. Format: PNG
4. Save with correct name

## Testing Your Images

After adding images:

1. Run the app: `python3.11 main.py`
2. You should see `apple.png` in the "Meme Output" window
3. Stick your tongue out
4. The image should change to `appletongue.png`

If images don't load:
- Check filenames (must be exact)
- Check file format (must be .png)
- Check location (same folder as main.py)
- Try opening the PNG in an image viewer to verify it's valid

## Creative Ideas

## Copyright Considerations

If you're sharing your project:

- ✅ **OK to use:**
  - Your own photos/drawings
  - Public domain images
  - Creative Commons (CC0) images
  - Emoji (generally okay for personal/educational use)

- ⚠️ **Ask permission or use differently:**
  - Copyrighted memes (better to create your own)
  - Celebrity photos
  - Brand logos
  - Professional photography

**Safe sources for free images:**
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Free high-quality photos
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Free stock photos

## Need Help?

**Images not showing?**
1. Check `main.py` output for error messages
2. Verify filenames are exactly `apple.png` and `appletongue.png`
3. Make sure files are in the correct directory
4. Try with simple emoji images first

**Want different behavior?**
- Edit `main.py` to change image names
- Add more images for different gestures (see TUTORIAL.md)
- Create a slideshow that cycles through images

Have fun creating! 🎨
